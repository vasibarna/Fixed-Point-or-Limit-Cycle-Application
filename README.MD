# Fixed Point or Limit Cycle Application

## Requisitions
Python 3.8.0

## Fixed Point
Calculates which is the fixed point of an integer, meaning that if we add the cube digits of a number we get the value of the number itself

## Limit Cycle
During calculation of the fixed point we might be in a scenario where last few number are repeated. If this happens we say that it's a limit cycle


## Cube of a positive integer digits
Return the sum of the all the cuber number till it is arrived at a fixed point or limit cycle
